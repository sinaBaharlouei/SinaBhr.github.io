# Biography

My name is Sina Baharlouei and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California (USC), studying Industrial and Systems Engineering. I am honored to have Professor [Meisam Razaviyayn](https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/) as my supervisor. Broadly speaking, my research interests encompass large-scale optimization theory and its applications in general machine learning models and in particular machine learning for Trustworthy AI (Fair and Robust Machine Learning).
