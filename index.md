# Biography

My name is Sina Baharlouei and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Southern California (USC), studying Industrial and Systems Engineering. I am honored to have Professor Meisam Razaviyayn as my supervisor. Broadly speaking, my research interests encompass large-scale optimization theory and its applications in general machine learning models and in particular machine learning for fairness, health, and medicine. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at the Amirkabir University of Technology.
